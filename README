1) copy anything good in your existing .bashrc or .bash_profile files to ~/bin/nix_conf/bash/<the appropriate file>, and then delete it from both files
2) add the contents of install_files/<both> to .bashrc and .bash_profile
3) diff the others... like vimrc, git/config, gitk, etc. and delete if they've got nothing good
4) . ~bin/nix_conf/install
